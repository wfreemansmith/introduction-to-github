They keep calling me

When figures from the past stand tall
And mocking voices ring the hall
Imperialistic house of prayer
Conquistadors who took their share

Someone take these dreams away
That point me to another day
A duel of personalities
That stretch all true realities

THEY KEEP CALLING ME

So I just blocked their number and that was the end of it really.
